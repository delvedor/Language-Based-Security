# Language-Based-Security
Repository of the exercises and the project of the Chalmers Language-Based Security Course.

##Project: Security evaluation of the ExpressJs framework


##Background: 
We are both Web Developers, and in the last year we worked a lot with NodeJs.
We have been working with Javascript language from three years, so we have a good experience with both Javascript and NodeJs environment.  
We worked a lot with web applications and we developed a few with ExpressJs, a framework for NodeJs.

Currently the web application security is a very important point of all the development process, and we decided to do this project to improve our standards of code quality and security in general.


##Main goal of the project:
In this project we are going to test and possibly improve the security of a web service written in ExpressJs ( by us ) and running on a NodeJs environment.


For reach that goals we will scan the web service searching for any vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to breach the system performing an attack based on the OWASP top 10 most critical web application security risks.


For every vulnerability found we will show and implement the best way to fix it, trying to do not get worse response time from the web service.      


##Relevance to Language Based Security:
In our opinion this project is very relevant to Language Based Security, because nowadays the web applications are increasingly common, so the security is becoming a very important part.


Both NodeJs and ExpressJs are released OpenSource on GitHub, so we can analyze the source code for implement our findings and improve the “power” of the attacks.


##Overview:
We will write a easy web application and we will test the top ten OWASP on the application.  
Then we will start to improve security by explaining what we gonna do and why.
At last we will analyze in depth two elements of the OWASP list and we will explain how to avoid that kind of attacks.
